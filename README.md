Balanced version of idea variation idea groups for Anbennar and some other stuff. Tries to balance the behemoth that is Anbennar for a more balanced SP and mainly MP. I know, weird endevour.

[quote]This is an addon so put this mod under Anbennar in the launcher.[/quote]

>Some stuff wont makes sense like that is new world related and does not have that Anbennar flavour, I will fix that as soon as I can. Government related idea groups do not work and neither do the religious ones for now.

>Still need to ensure complete compatability as this mod came about due to request from my friends, additionally there is still an issue with some values. Also I literally went over the files today so there might be issues, you are beta branch monkeys if you try to play this. So save frequently.
