# Doge_Anbennar
 tweaks to Anbennar idea system


What is this?
>A much more balanced version of idea groups for Anbennar. Gives flavour and direction to your country but wont skyrocket your manpower to insane levels. It also changes policies.

How to?
>This is an addon so put this mod under Anbennar in the launcher.






Problems
>Some stuff wont makes sense like that is new world related and does not have that Anbennar flavour, I will fix that as soon as I can. Government related idea groups do not work and neither do the religious ones for now.

>Still need to ensure complete compatability as this mod came about due to request from my friends, additionally there is still an issue with some values. Also I literally went over the files today so there might be issues, you are beta branch monkeys if you try to play this. So save frequently.

Scope
>The main focus is on ideas however, there is an increase cost for advisors per year and instead of getting 50% discounts it should be 25%. The focus basically to balance the behemoth that is Anbennar for more balanced SP and mainly MP. I know, dumb endevour.





The balance comes from my Doge Shattered Europe so feel free to check that too I guess.
